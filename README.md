# CodSoft Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple Data Science Intership projects. Each project has its own dataset, which is used for training and evaluating machine learning models.

## Projects and Datasets

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Folder**: `CodSoft/CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION`
- **Dataset**: `creditcard.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

### 2. Iris Flower Classification
- **Folder**: `CodSoft/IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION`
- **Datasets**: `IRIS.csv`, `IRIS -1.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the species of the flower.

### 3. Sales Prediction Using Python
- **Folder**: `CodSoft/SALES-PREDICTION-USING-PYTHON`
- **Datasets**: `advertising - 1.csv`, `advertising.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains advertising data, including the amount spent on TV, radio, and newspaper advertisements, and the corresponding sales figures.

### 4. Titanic Survival Prediction
- **Folder**: `CodSoft/TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION`
- **Datasets**: `Titanic_Prediction.csv`, `Titanic-Dataset.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains information about the passengers of the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, their class, age, and other attributes.

### 5. Movie Rating Prediction with Python
- **Folder**: `CodSoft/MOVIE-RATING-PREDICTION-WITH-PYTHON`
- **Dataset**: `IMDb Movies India.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains information about movies in India, including their ratings, genre, and other attributes.

## Usage

Each folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) that demonstrates how to load the dataset, preprocess the data, build and train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
